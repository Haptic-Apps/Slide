<div class="md"><div>Hey guys, I wanted to share a build I recently put together. It&#39;s a really capable gaming build made up of almost all used parts with the intent of trying to push the performance per dollar limit. I spent exactly $263.97 (this includes shipping and taxes, which there was none) and utilized hardwareswap almost entirely (ebay and amazon helped a bit too). I did not include the price for an operating system, as Windows 10 un-activated is completely usable minus the &quot;Personalize&quot; option being disabled and having a watermark, and should be completely legal since you&#39;re not cracking or pirating it (feels like they&#39;re just giving it away in hopes that they keep the lead in market share or something huh?). Either that or you can use the Windows key from the previous obsolete computer you&#39;re leaving for the new build. </div>

    <div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I_9FoC-X3E&amp;feature=autoshare">I detailed the entire process in a video here and tested it against Witcher 3 (I would have tested MGS5 and Fallout4 too but the video was already getting long). Sorry it&#39;s in an informative video fashion. It&#39;s probably over explained on the simple things and under explained on the tech and spec side for readers of this subreddit but I originally made the video for people with less knowledge of computers and without the intent to post here until someone suggested me to do so.</a></div>

    <div>I haven&#39;t really seen video posts here from what I can recall. If this type of a post is not allowed let me know, I read over the rules (and rare rules) rigorously to make sure this wasn&#39;t breaking any and could not find anything. I figured that text posts are already super helpful, picture posts are helpful + worth a thousand words, so a video post with a real world example might be all of the above.</div>

    <div>EDIT: Didn&#39;t have too many pictures of the build process as I was recording mostly, but here are a couple: </div>
